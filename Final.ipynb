    "Human-induced earthquakes is becoming an important topic in political and scientific discussions and is now vastly reported by the media. It is well known that surface and underground mining, reservoir depletion, injection and withdrawal of fluids and gas from the subsurface are capable of inducing slip on preexisting faults and potentially earthquakes of various magnitudes. Since 2009, new drilling technologies have given access to oil and gas in previously unproductive geological formations."

   "source": [
    "The recent increase of small to large earthquake events in central and eastern United States has fueled concern that hydraulic fracturing could be responsible for the increase of the rate of earthquake acitivity. Since 2009, the oil industry has expanded its use of the hydraulic fracturing technique because of the high price of oil that makes the extraction of unconventional oil and gas now economically viable. Microearthquakes (magnitude lower than 2) are routinely generated as part of the hydraulic fracturing process (fracking) to stimulate oil and gas reservoir. However the currently practiced protocol has low risk of inducing destructive earthquakes. Over the past **100,000 fracking wells drilled**, the **biggest earthquake recorded was of magnitude 3.6**, which is too small to pose serious safety risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Nevertheless, the correlation between the increase of fracking and earthquake events has drawn lots of attention from both the scientific community and the media. Ellsworth [2013] claims that some of the seismicity is associated with the increase in saltwater disposal that comes from 'flow-back' water after multistage fracturing operations (see the National Research Council report, *Induced Seismicity Potential in Energy Technologies* [2012]). Once the unconventional oil is extracted, along with the contaminated saltwater, this latter is reinjected into deeper sedimentary geological formations with high porosity and permeability via regulated class II underground injection control (UIC) wells. Sometimes the saline water is reinjected as part of water-flooding enchanced oil recovery. However the large increase of earthquake activity is thought to be associated with the disposal wells.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since 2009, Oklahoma has been impacted by a significant increase of earthquake events. The exponential increase of the number of earhquakes affects all range of magnitude, from the smallest to the largest earthquake sizes. Furthemore, in this state, the number of saltwater disposal wells have increased dramatically. Sometimes, the sedimentary geological formation used to store the contaminated saltwater is hydraulically connected to the crystalline bedrock. The increase of pore fluid pressure on preexisting fault surfaces in crystalline rocks weakens the fault and can potentially trigger earthquakes. For example several of the largest earthquakes in United States in 2011 and 2012 have been triggered by disposal wells. The **largest was of magnitude 5.6 in Prague, central Oklahoma in 2011** and destroyed 12 homes and injured 2 people. However, only a small fraction of the **30,000 disposal wells** appears to pose safety risk issues. It becomes important to understand the processes of injection-induced seismicity."

    "We collect some data from the Oklahoma Geological Survey on the history of earthquake events localized in Oklahoma state during the past century. From their website http://www.okgeosurvey1.gov we can access an Earthquakes catalog which gives us precious information on the data, location and magnitude of earthquakes. In order to download this catalog we write the following simple script. Because the catalog is very sparse for the years before the onset of modern seismic recording (1974), we only load the catalog for the years after 1980. It is claimed that the catalog is 'fairly complete to a minimum magnitude of 2.9 from 1980 to present'. "
